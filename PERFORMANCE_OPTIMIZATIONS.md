# Performance Optimizations Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive performance optimizations implemented to address slow page loading times (previously 3-9 seconds) and achieve consistent sub-1-second load times.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. Multiple Duplicate API Calls ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Same product endpoint called 6+ times (e.g., `plecak-1747245341861-0j1f7s` with different variants)

**Solution**: 
- Implemented advanced `RequestDeduplicator` with caching in `src/lib/utils/performance.ts`
- Created specialized deduplicators: `measurementDeduplicator`, `productDeduplicator`, `imageDeduplicator`
- Updated `measurements.ts` to use request deduplication
- Added cache hit/miss tracking and performance monitoring

### 2. Large JavaScript Bundle (4.1MB) ✅ OPTIMIZED
**Problem**: Single 4.1MB `page.js` file taking 500-800ms to load

**Solution**: Enhanced `next.config.ts` with:
- Advanced code splitting with smaller chunk sizes (200KB max in production)
- Separate chunks for framework, Medusa SDK, search libraries, UI components
- Better tree shaking with `usedExports: true` and `sideEffects: false`
- Development optimizations for faster builds
- Lodash-es optimization for smaller bundle size

### 3. Slow Server-Side Rendering ✅ OPTIMIZED
**Problem**: RSC requests taking 4-9 seconds

**Solution**:
- Implemented caching in measurements API with 1-hour revalidation
- Added request deduplication to prevent duplicate server requests
- Optimized VariantSelectionContext with debounced updates (300ms)
- Added performance tracking for render times

### 4. Inefficient Image Loading ✅ OPTIMIZED
**Problem**: Multiple image requests without proper optimization

**Solution**:
- Created `OptimizedImage` component with:
  - Automatic size optimization
  - Prefetching capabilities
  - Error handling and fallbacks
  - Performance tracking in development
  - Batch prefetching hook (`usePrefetchImages`)

### 5. Context Re-render Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: VariantSelectionContext causing excessive re-renders

**Solution**:
- Added memoization with `useMemo` for context values
- Implemented debounced URL updates (300ms)
- Added ref-based tracking to prevent duplicate updates
- Performance measurement integration

## New Components Created

### 1. Enhanced Performance Utilities (`src/lib/utils/performance.ts`)
- Advanced caching with LRU eviction
- Request deduplication with statistics
- Performance monitoring with emojis for better debugging
- Prefetching utilities for API, images, and routes

### 2. OptimizedImage Component (`src/components/common/OptimizedImage.tsx`)
- Intelligent size optimization
- Prefetching support
- Error handling with fallbacks
- Development performance indicators
- Batch prefetching hook

### 3. Performance Monitor Component (`src/components/common/PerformanceMonitor.tsx`)
- Real-time performance statistics (development only)
- Cache hit rates and sizes
- Request deduplication metrics
- Manual cache clearing functionality

## Performance Monitoring

### Development Tools
1. **Performance Monitor**: Shows real-time stats in bottom-right corner
2. **Console Logging**: Emoji-based performance indicators:
   - ✅ Fast operations (<500ms)
   - ⚠️ Slow operations (500ms-1s)
   - 🐌 Very slow operations (>1s)
   - 💾 Cache hits/misses
   - 🔄 Request deduplication

### Key Metrics Tracked
- API call performance with timing
- Cache hit rates
- Request deduplication statistics
- Component render times
- Bundle sizes and chunk loading

## Usage Examples

### Using OptimizedImage
```tsx
import { OptimizedImage } from "@/components/common/OptimizedImage"

<OptimizedImage
  src={product.thumbnail}
  alt={product.title}
  width={384}
  height={384}
  priority={true}
  prefetch={true}
/>
```

### Using Performance Monitor
```tsx
import { PerformanceMonitor } from "@/components/common/PerformanceMonitor"

// Add to your root layout (development only)
<PerformanceMonitor />
```

### Manual Cache Management
```tsx
import { measurementDeduplicator } from "@/lib/utils/performance"

// Clear specific cache
measurementDeduplicator.invalidate('product-123')

// Clear by pattern
measurementDeduplicator.invalidatePattern('product-.*')

// Get statistics
const stats = measurementDeduplicator.getStats()
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization
- Page loads: 3-9 seconds (inconsistent)
- Multiple duplicate API calls (6+ for same endpoint)
- Large bundle sizes (4.1MB single file)
- Excessive re-renders

### After Optimization
- **Target**: Consistent sub-1-second page loads
- **API Calls**: Deduplicated with caching (should see 80%+ cache hit rate)
- **Bundle Size**: Split into smaller chunks (<200KB each)
- **Re-renders**: Minimized with memoization and debouncing

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Network Tab Analysis**: 
   - Verify no duplicate API calls
   - Check smaller chunk sizes
   - Monitor cache headers

2. **Performance Monitor**: 
   - Check cache hit rates (target: >80%)
   - Monitor request deduplication
   - Verify render performance

3. **Lighthouse Scores**:
   - Performance score should improve
   - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) should be <2.5s
   - First Input Delay (FID) should be <100ms

## Maintenance Notes

- Cache TTL is set to 5 minutes for most operations
- Maximum cache sizes: 100-200 items per deduplicator
- Performance monitoring only runs in development
- All optimizations are backward compatible

## Next Steps

1. Monitor performance in production
2. Adjust cache TTL based on usage patterns
3. Consider implementing service worker for additional caching
4. Add more granular performance metrics as needed
