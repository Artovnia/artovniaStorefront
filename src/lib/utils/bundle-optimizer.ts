/**
 * BUNDLE OPTIMIZATION APPROACH:
 * 
 * Instead of complex utilities, we use simple React.lazy() for code splitting:
 * - AlgoliaProductsListing and ProductListing are lazy-loaded
 * - This reduces initial bundle size by splitting heavy components
 * - Enhanced Suspense fallbacks provide immediate loading feedback
 * - Combined with server-side optimizations in categories.ts
 * 
 * This approach is simpler, more reliable, and achieves the same goal
 * of reducing the 4.2 MB bundle size without TypeScript complexity.

// This file was replaced with direct React.lazy() usage in page components
// for better maintainability and fewer potential issues.
